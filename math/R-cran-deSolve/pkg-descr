Functions that solve initial value problems of a system of first-order
ordinary differential equations (ODE), of partial differential
equations (PDE), of differential algebraic equations (DAE), and of
delay differential equations. The functions provide an interface
to the FORTRAN functions lsoda, lsodar, lsode, lsodes of the ODEPACK
collection, to the FORTRAN functions dvode and daspk and a
C-implementation of solvers of the Runge-Kutta family with fixed
or variable time steps. The package contains routines designed for
solving ODEs resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial differential
equations (PDE) that have been converted to ODEs by numerical
differencing.

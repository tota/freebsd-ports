The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) is a library containing
many standard implementations of neural networks. This package wraps
the SNNS functionality to make it available from within R. Using
the RSNNS low-level interface, all of the algorithmic functionality
and flexibility of SNNS can be accessed. Furthermore, the package
contains a convenient high-level interface, so that the most common
neural network topologies and learning algorithms integrate seamlessly
into R.

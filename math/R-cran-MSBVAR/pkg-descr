MSBVAR provides methods for estimating frequentist and Bayesian
Vector Autoregression (VAR) models and Markov-switching Bayesian
VAR (MSBVAR). Functions for reduced form and structural VAR models
are also available. Includes methods for the generating posterior
inferences for these models, forecasts, impulse responses (using
likelihood-based error bands), and forecast error decompositions.
Also includes utility functions for plotting forecasts and impulse
responses, and generating draws from Wishart and singular multivariate
normal densities. Current version includes functionality to build
and evaluate models with Markov switching.

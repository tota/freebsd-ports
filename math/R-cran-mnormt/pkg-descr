Functions are provided for computing the density and the distribution
function of multivariate normal and "t" random variables, and for
generating random vectors sampled from these distributions.
Probabilities are computed via a non-Monte Carlo method. Different
routines are used for the case d=1, d=2, d>2, if d denotes the
number of dimensions.

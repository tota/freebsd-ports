profileModel provides tools that can be used to calculate, evaluate,
plot and use for inference the profiles of arbitrary inference
functions for arbitrary 'glm'-like fitted models with linear
predictors. In addition, it allows the developers of fitting
procedures to use these capabilities by simply writing a function
for the appropriate objective to be profiled.

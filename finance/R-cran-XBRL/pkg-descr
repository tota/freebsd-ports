XBRL is a package suited to extract business financial information
from an Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) instance file
and the associated collection of files that defines its Discoverable
Taxonomy Set (DTS). These files are usually disseminated across
different remote locations. XBRL documents employ many technologies
defined by XML standards, such as XML Schema, Namespaces, XLink,
and XPath, which make the extraction of information involved. The
functions provided by this package address this complexity, returning
data frames containing the enclosed information readily available
to perform analyses. XBRL has been successfully tested in analyzing
10-K and 10-Q submissions from USA filing companies that are publicly
available at the EDGAR system of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). As published taxonomy files (such as
"http://xbrl.fasb.org/us-gaap/2013/elts/us-gaap-2013-01-31.xsd")
are immutable and are used by most filers, XBRL offers the option
of downloading them only the first time they are referred, keeping
a local cache copy that can be used from then on. This speeds-up
the process, specially on slow connections. XBRL is not and does
not aim to be (at least yet) a validating XBRL processor. XBRL is
still a work in progress. As such, functions and produced data
frames may change structure in future versions until stabilization.

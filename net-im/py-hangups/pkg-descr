hangups is the first third-party instant messaging client for Google
Hangouts. It includes both a Python library and a reference client
with a text-based user interface.

Unlike its predecessor Google Talk, Hangouts uses a proprietary,
non-interoperable protocol. hangups is implemented by reverse-engineering
this protocol, which allows it to support features like group
messaging that aren't available in clients that connect via XMPP.
